# Rapid Proto Kit

Opinionated boilerplate and suite of components for quickly creating React based prototypes.

## Setup

Bare bones Vite... `npm install`, then `npm run dev`. Default Vite port... http://localhost:5173/. Prefer to run in a [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), configuration is included.
